## Human Resource Policies

**RECRUITMENT -** The Human resource is saddled with the responsibility of carrying out interviews and the selection process.

This Interview and selection process would be carried out within 7 Working days after advert placement.


**ONBOARDING -**  After the Offer Letter has been sent and accepted by the prospective Employee, an Official Onboarding form the HR Should commence, which is expected to be concluded in 2 Working days, after which the employee would be handed over to the Team Lead . During onboarding, employees are introduced to the abundance of resources they’ll need to succeed, e.g., role descriptions, performance expectations, E-Process Documents and required training. These logistics are always handled by HR personnel, using the Onboarding Checklist below;

**PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT -** It is the responsibility of the HRM, to conduct the Annual Performance Appraisal, of all Core Staff, Management Staff, Junior Staff and Innovators. Nonetheless, a quarterly appraisal would be conducted, in order to ascertain the level of performance within that Quarter.

**REGULATORY COMPLIANCE -** All staff and Innovators, are to carefully read the RIL Policies and Regulations, and provide their signature where necessary in order to be held accountable in cases of insubordination or noncompliance to policies. 

- **Lateness:** The stipulated resumption time is 9a.m, and if for any reason a staff or innovator would be late, the HRM must be informed prior to the time.

- **Absenteeism:** If for any reason a staff or innovator would be absent from work, an official email should be sent to the HRM, stating the reason for absence. Any recurring lateness or absence without due permission, would result in a severe penalty from the Management. 

- **Visitors:** The purpose of every visit should be clearly stated and documented on the Timesheet.

**PROCESS COMPLIANCE:** The HRM is saddled with the responsibility of ensuring that all processes for each Lab, if accurately followed, and compliance is absolute.
