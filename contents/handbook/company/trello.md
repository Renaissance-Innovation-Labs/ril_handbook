All Users should have at least one item in this state.
Any Ongoing Task should be deleted from the To Do column
There should be a Timeline attached to each Card in this column 
Task Here can be broken into bits especially where a checklist is applicable.
Documents, Designs, Links, Videos can be attached here for reference purpose.

### CODE REVIEW
  
This list is for items in code review. 
When a task has gotten approval, it moves off to Testing.
If there are too many cards here, we should break off from other tasks to get code review done.

### TESTING

Cards come here after being code reviewed, and we're in a place for QA and fixing things QA finds. 
Design review also happens at this stage

### DONE 

Completed Task. 
Only Team Lead for Product Team is expected to Push a Task to the Done Column. 

Links to the completed Task should be attached to the Done Column.
