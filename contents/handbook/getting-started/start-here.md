Welcome to the RIL Handbook! If you are a new starter, this page will help highlight some of the most important things you should know about working here. 

## What We Do

We facilitate technological experiments from ideation to formation of business units, and translate solutions to enterprise.

We find areas right for disruption by engaging diverse participants in open collaboration. These participants (innovators) are taken through a guided learning process that equips them with the requisite knowledge and skill for progress. Together, we’re able to engineer innovative prototypes and explore opportunities with contributors, mentors, and sponsors.

We take on challenges too big for one organization by engaging diverse participants to create, elaborate, and prototype disruptive solutions. 

<!-- ## How we work

Now it's time to dive into some of the more practical stuff - these are the most important pages:

1. [Communication](/handbook/company/communication) - we have a distinctive style. If RIL is your first all-remote company, this page is especially helpful.
2. [Team structure](/handbook/small-teams/team-structure) - we are structured in Small Teams. These pages will help you get the lay of the land, and who does what. 
3. [Management](/handbook/company/management) - we have a relatively unusual approach to management, and it is possible that you will not be familiar with our approach.  -->
