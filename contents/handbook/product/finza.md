## Overview

Individuals (Nigerians) and businesses in the United States and Canada who have the need to send money to Nigeria still face difficulties doing that. Many still rely on Remittance Service Providers (RSPs) regardless of the high transansaction fees and poor exchange rates.

Nigerians who have the need to do international transactions still encounter difficulties as well because of the daily transaction limits on their USD cards or USD virtual cards.

Finza is an international fund transfer platform that sends funds from the US/Canada to Nigeria within 5 minutes and also a USD virtual card platform that processes international transactions easily and smoothly in seconds.

This product will create a seamless experience around remittance and online transactions.

##	Problem and Solution
We realized that Nigerians and businesses in the diaspora face a lot of difficulties sending funds to Nigeria. It takes up to 24 hrs for payment confirmation, also at a poor exchange rate and high transaction costs. 

The US and Canada are home to a large Nigerian community who are  looking for the best possible means to send money â€˜homeâ€™.  A good number of companies who hire Nigerian freelancers and creatives also face the challenge with immediate payment.

In order to build an effective solution, we looked at the current available processes and carved a pathway that reduces delay in fund transfer by making the swys wallet apis serve as a payment gateway.

We built Finza to provide individuals and businesses with a platform where they can seamlessly do the following:

- Make payments with ease to Nigeria from USA and Canada
- Receive payments with ease from USA and Canada to Nigeria.
- Fund wallet, view balance and all transactions history 
- Export all transactions to Excel. CSV and PDF. 

In a nutshell, we help individuals and businesses by providing them with the easiest and most reliable payments solution and weâ€™ll continue to innovate so that our customers will have the experience they canâ€™t get elsewhere.

# Discoveries

As we improve our Product, it's key to have a guiding metric that we can all at Product & Engineering rally behind and measure our progress against. For the Product, this metric is **Discoveries**. The metric can be tracked in the [product dashboard][dashboard] and is reported weekly at PostHog News.

> ðŸ’¡ Discoveries is different from Discovered Learnings. Discovered Learnings is used as a metric for activation and growth.

Generally, small teams should be making measurable impact towards improving this metric (not all teams, not all the time). It's okay for epics and sprints to have other intermediate (and probably more concrete) goals, but overall each team should be moving the metric as a whole.

## What is a Discovery?
The metric is defined [in this action][action]. The concept of the metric is users driving insights from PostHog, so any of these actions:
- Analyzing any insight. Analyzing means viewing for 10 seconds or more. Insights include: trends, funnels, paths, lifecycle, stickiness.
- Analyzing a recording. Watching a recording for 10 seconds or more.
- Analyzing a correlation analysis report. Analyzing means viewing for 10 seconds or more. 
- Analyzing a dashboard. Analyzing means viewing a dashboard for 10 seconds or more. Viewing a dashboard does not fire "insight analyzed" events for its dashboard items. _Introduced on Feb 21, 2022._


**Adding new insights**
We're continuously improving the product and it's inevitable that we'll add more more insights. When we add more insights, they should either fire the already existing "insight viewed" & "insight analyzed" events (with adjusted properties), or the new event should be added to the action definition. In either case, it's important to **update this document, so we have a clear log of when new insights were added.**


**Exclusions**
We exclude the following events from counting as they don't signal getting actual value from PostHog:
- Events done on test projects.
- Insights where it's the first component load (i.e. you just open the insights page and don't change any config nor move to any other insight).
  - Indirectly, this means we also don't count when a user shares an insight link and just opens that link. This is deliberate as we believe this is not about discovering a new insight, but rather collaboration.


## Additional context
- The metric is purposefully kept simple to make it easy to action and avoid complex edge cases in an already ambiguous landscape (product changes all the time).
- Why not _Discovered Learnings_? It seems to have a higher correlation to retention, but:
  - It limits us only to trends and funnels, and users drive value from a variety of other sources. We're particularly investing in providing more value in others parts of the app too.
  - While Discovered Learnings seems to lead to higher levels of retention percentually, in absolute numbers we retain more users through Discoveries (1).
  - Counts when users open an insight shared by another user (direct link).
- Caveat: This metric also captures any value from Marketing efforts. As we start to invest more in user acquisition, we'll need to isolate the effect from Marketing in this Product metric.


(1): _A test carried out on Oct 6 with cohorts from Aug 8 to Aug 29, 2021 revealed that Discoveries show 2.3x more retained users (in absolute numbers) and had an F1-score 33% higher than for Discovered Learnings._
