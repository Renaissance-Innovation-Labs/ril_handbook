## Overview

**Goal:** This project is to create a demo tour for various deposit products stated on the website 
 
**How it works:**

When users launch a deposit website, users should be able to view the various products on the website with a tour section for each application

The tour’s goal is to give clients various user perspectives and how each user can use the application. The tour will have screens, tooltips and short stories to explain how that screen works. It will also include a function to show how the color customization feature works on the applications and where these colors affect.

The Demo will be scalable, clear and explainable.
