## Context

We started as a company by investing heavily in nurturing local talents. We hosted the international space app challenge by partnering with other tech communities in Port Harcourt. 
Our focus as a company is to revolutionise Africa’s tech space, therefore, every step we take is one move closer to that.

We launched our fellowship programme in 2021 to unite young innovators with a chance at technological advancement. We had over 25 innovators in our fellowship. In the same year, with the fellowship programme, we figured out how to reach more talents, and we realized where to throw in our focus.

Today, we are building in-house products that we intend to make open to the general public. We are also, optimizing events and a kids club to reach more people and get early tech talents. 

We are currently reaching more people and getting them into the tech pipeline than before.
