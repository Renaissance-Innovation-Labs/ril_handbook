Hi, I’m a Frontend Developer. I love to create beautiful and performant products with great user experiences.
I chose frontend development because I get the opportunity to solve problems and still be visually creative.
With experience in ui/ux, I am able to interpret designs, patterns, and how it affects the end users, making good calls in implementation.
I love reading, writing, music, taking long walks making friends and having conversations.
Achievements:
I made a significantly contribution to Open source through Outreachy this year(2022).
