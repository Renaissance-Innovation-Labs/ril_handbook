I’m a Frontend Engineer geared towards implementing pexel based designs and technicalities to produce responsive web and mobile designs across all industries.
I’m well skilled at improving design flows and functionalities to improve user experiences and deliver products that are enjoyable and easy to use.
I understand the development processes and how it applies to bringing design ideas into products that solve the problems of people.
I’m also a Frontend Team Lead and I do this by reviewing designs before development phase, and the codebase needed for effective solving of human problems digitally.
