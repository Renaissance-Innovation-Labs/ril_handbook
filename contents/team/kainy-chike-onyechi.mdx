I’m a front-end developer with over 3 years of experience building performant and responsive web applications, with delightful user experience.
I love everything about the tech world so much so that it steers almost all of my interests, but I chose to specialise in frontend development because simple UI solutions could be used to solve complex problems and with the help of my super analytical thinking skills, I have been able to spin up simple solutions to complex problems that users would love to interact with.
When I’m not writing code, I love to consume tech content (both computer hardware and software tech) and also to listen to music.
