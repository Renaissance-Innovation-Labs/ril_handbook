A quintessential legal practitioner, called to the Nigerian Bar at a very young age, I knew that I wanted to make a difference in the vast and fast developing frontiers of law.
Being proficient in Intellectual Property Law made understanding Tech Law and its application relatively easy and exciting, in a country where it is not a very explored area of law.
I live for new challenges and ways of developing myself, that is why I'm always found in the hall ways of career defining areas of learning, ie; Intellectual Property Law, Tech Law, Entertainment Law, Business Law, Corporate Law, Web and Software development.
