I’m a Product Designer geared towards embracing empathetic design and principles to produce high-performing digital interfaces with a sprinkle of confidence.
I’m skilled at improving workflow to improve user experiences and deliver products that are enjoyable and easy to use.
I understand the design thinking process and how it applies to bringing ideas into products that solve the problems of people.
I’m also a UX Design advocate and I do this by providing resources and contents that increase the desire solving human problems digitally.
<!-- Achievements:
I currently  run a community (BEYOND PEEXELS) of UI/UX Designer and the aim is to make them see beyond the tools and think of design a problem solving skill thereby applying it to our daily lives.
I also contribute to open source projects and currently contributing to CHAOSS
 Africa and Open Source Design Africa (OSDA). -->
